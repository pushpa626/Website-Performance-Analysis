**Website Performance Analysis**

Website Performance Analysis is a crucial aspect of ensuring a website's success. It involves examining various metrics to assess a website's functionality, user engagement, and ability to achieve business goals.
This analysis is vital because it has a direct impact on:

User Experience: A slow, unresponsive, or poorly designed website can lead to frustrated users, high bounce rates, and a negative reputation.
Conversion Rates: A website that is optimized for performance can improve conversion rates, leading to increased sales, leads, or other desired actions.
Profitability: A website that is slow or unresponsive can lead to lost revenue, decreased sales, and a negative impact on the bottom line.
Reputation: A website that is slow, unresponsive, or poorly designed can damage a business's reputation and erode trust with customers.
Some common metrics used in Website Performance Analysis include:

Page Load Time: The time it takes for a webpage to fully load.
Bounce Rate: The percentage of users who leave a website without taking any further action.
Conversion Rate: The percentage of users who complete a desired action, such as making a purchase or filling out a form.
